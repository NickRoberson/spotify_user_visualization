			I love music, always have. It's in most of my fondest memories from when I was a child, and continues to be now that I am older and in college.
			When I got to Grinnell College, after graiduating from Geoerge Mason High School in Virginia, I knew that I wanted to incorporate music into my 
			college experience somehow. Right now you are looking at the culmination of that goal. This spring (2017), after completing a data visualization
			course I decided that I wanted to make a tool that helps people discover new music. I chose spotify because, at the time, it is one of the largest
			music streaming services out there, plus it has a great API.

		Born in 1995, I grew up in Falls Church City, Virginia with two siblings, a sister Carly and a brother John. After graduating from George Mason
		High School in 2014, I started school at Grinnell College with the class of 2018. During my time at Grinnell so far I have declared a Computer 
		Science major as well as become captain of the water polo and swim teams. In the fall of 2016, I studied abroad in Budapest, Hungary at the 
		Aquincum Institute of Technology (AIT), a study abroad program geared towards Math and Computer Science majors. Here, with ~65 other students 
		from small liberal arts colleges across the country, is where I got the inspiration to make this website. <br><br>
		
		At AIT and Grinnell I have had the pleasure of meeting some of the smartest and most motivational people I'convinced I will ever know. I really 
		have them to thank for this, for keeping me in gear and never letting me lose sight of why I set out to create this tool. To help people discover
		new music through their own interests.
